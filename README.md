## ⚙️ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (or yarn) installed on your machine.
You also need a **MongoDB** database. You can use a local instance or a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/p-v-srinag/MediConnect-Doctor-Appointment.git](https://github.com/p-v-srinag/MediConnect-Doctor-Appointment.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd MediConnect-Doctor-Appointment
    ```

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=<Your_MongoDB_Connection_String>
    JWT_SECRET=<Your_JWT_Secret>
    ```
4.  **Start the backend server:** (This will use nodemon to watch for changes)
    ```sh
    npx nodemon start
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Open a new terminal** and navigate to the client directory from the root folder:
    ```sh
    cd client
    ```
2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`!
